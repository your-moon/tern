//! SSH client sessions for tern.
//!
//! Events are delivered over an `async-channel` and prompts are answered through
//! `futures::channel::oneshot` senders, so the consumer (GPUI) does not need a tokio
//! context; the session itself runs on the tokio runtime handle passed to [`connect`].
//!
//! A host with a `ProxyCommand` in `~/.ssh/config` is reached through that command, as
//! OpenSSH does; it is resolved once, with the rest of the alias, into [`ConnectSpec`].
