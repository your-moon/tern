<p align="center">
  A fast, native SSH client for macOS, written in Rust on <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/gpui">GPUI</a>.<br>
  Your servers one click away, passwords that fill themselves, and a window you'll enjoy looking at.

## Why tern

- **One click to a shell.** Saved connections in groups, ⌘K to jump to any of them, and a status line with latency and session time.
- **Passwords that stay out of the way.** Logins come from your SSH key, your password manager (`gopass show -o …`), or tern's encrypted vault. At a `sudo` prompt, **⌘\\** types the password for you.
- **Built for real work.** Split panes, find in scrollback, clickable links, snippets, SFTP file browser, port forwards, ProxyJump, agent forwarding, broadcast input, session logs, and automatic reconnect.
- **Your setup, backed up.** Hosts, snippets and settings sync to a private Git repository you own, encrypted end to end.
- **Native and light.** About 85 MB in Activity Monitor with a wallpaper showing (measured, [docs/perf.md](docs/perf.md)). It reads crisp on 1080p monitors, and sits on frosted glass over a wallpaper of your choice.

## Features

**Connections**
- Saved connections with groups and tags, search (⇧⌘F), and a ⌘K picker ordered by what you used last.
- Import from `~/.ssh/config` as a one-time copy; tern keeps its own list.
- ProxyJump chains, local, remote and dynamic (SOCKS) port forwards, agent forwarding, and keep-alive per host.
- Automatic reconnect after a network drop, with backoff. It never reconnects after you type `exit`.
- Two-factor (keyboard-interactive) logins, and a hard stop on changed host keys, with the exact `ssh-keygen -R` line to fix one you trust.

**Terminal**
- Tabs you can rename, reorder and reopen on launch; split panes; broadcast input to chosen tabs.
- Find in scrollback, ⌘-click links (including OSC 8), cursor shape and blink, scrollback length, copy on select, and visual bell.
- SFTP browser, session logging to a file, and a status line showing host, state, latency and session time.

**Passwords and keys**
- **Password command** per connection, such as `gopass show -o work/ssh/web-01`. tern runs it when the server asks and never stores the result. A command that arrives through sync must be approved once on each Mac.
- **Vault**: an age-encrypted file for passwords and SSH keys (generate ed25519, import, copy the public key). It unlocks with a PIN or through the macOS Keychain, and locks after you've been idle.
- **⌘\\ Fill password** at `sudo` and other password prompts. It never types on its own.

**Sync**
- To a private Git repository through your own `git` and SSH key (or a GitHub gist). Everything is encrypted with your vault passphrase before it leaves the Mac.
- It runs on its own when something changes and every few minutes. When both sides changed, it merges per file and per host, and only asks about a real conflict.

**Look**
- zeron-style chrome, tinted to your wallpaper. Panels are frosted glass over one backdrop, and the picture shows sharp in the empty view.
- Light, dark or system appearance. A "sharper text" mode for 1× monitors. Reduce motion follows macOS.

## Memory

tern against the other two SSH clients, on the same Mac, the same day (2026-10-06), the same way. Each app was launched fresh and measured every 15 s for two minutes with macOS `footprint` (the number Activity Monitor shows), summed over all of its processes. The table gives the settled value at two minutes. "Connected" means one tab logged in to the same server.

| App | Idle | Connected | Processes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **tern** | **86 MB** (108 MB with a wallpaper) | **76 MB** (125 MB with a wallpaper) | 1 |
| Tabby | 471 MB | 580 MB | 5 (Electron) |
| Termius | 583 MB | not measured | 7 (Electron) |

Connected, tern needs between a quarter and an eighth of Tabby's memory; idle, between a fifth and a seventh of either app's. The method, raw samples and the plain terminals (Terminal, iTerm2, Ghostty) are in [docs/perf.md](docs/perf.md).

## Keyboard

| Action | Keys | Action | Keys |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Host picker | ⌘K | Split right / down | ⌘D / ⌘⇧D |
| Search hosts | ⇧⌘F | Move between panes | ⌥⌘ + arrows |
| New connection | ⌘N | Find in scrollback | ⌘F |
| Snippets | ⇧⌘S | Fill password | ⌘\\ |
| Browse files | ⇧⌘O | Close pane / tab | ⌘W |
| Settings | ⌘, | Next / previous tab | ⇧⌘] / ⇧⌘[ |
| Toggle sidebar | ⌘B | Text size | ⌘= / ⌘− / ⌘0 |

Every shortcut can be rebound in Settings → Shortcuts.

## Install

**Download:** get `tern-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/your-moon/tern/releases), open it, and drag tern to Applications. Releases are signed with a Developer ID and notarised by Apple, so it opens without a warning.

**Build from source** (Rust 1.99+, macOS on Apple silicon):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-moon/tern && cd tern
scripts/make-local-identity.sh   # once: a stable local signature, so Keychain access survives updates
scripts/bundle-app.sh            # builds target/release/bundle/tern.app
cp -R target/release/bundle/tern.app /Applications/
cargo install --locked --path crates/tern   # the `tern` command (tern <host>, tern vault init)
```

## Security

- Host keys are checked against `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. A changed key refuses the connection.
- Secrets live in the vault (age, scrypt) or in your password manager. They are never written to logs, and never typed into the terminal unless you press ⌘\\.
- Sync data is encrypted before it leaves your Mac. The repository only ever sees `.age` files.
- Report vulnerabilities privately, as described in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

Losing a Mac doesn't lose your setup: see [docs/recovery.md](docs/recovery.md).

## Design and development

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.html), [UI spec](docs/ui.md), [performance](docs/perf.md), and the [craft rules](CRAFT.md) every change passes.
- `cargo test --workspace` runs the suite, including SSH tests against an in-process server. `cargo run -p tern-ssh --example password_server -- --demo` starts the demo server used for these screenshots.
