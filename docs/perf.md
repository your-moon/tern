# Memory and performance

## Where the memory goes

| Item | Cost | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One terminal cell | 24 bytes | `alacritty_terminal` 0.26 `term/cell.rs:303` |
| One scrollback row | columns × 24 B, allocated full-width even when empty | `grid/storage.rs:133` |
| Scrollback growth | lazy, in chunks of ≥1,000 rows; freed when shrunk >1,000 below capacity | `grid/storage.rs:111,133` |
| Full scrollback, 200 cols | 10,000 lines = 48 MB/tab · 5,000 lines = 24 MB/tab | arithmetic |

## SSH session buffers (tern-ssh)

| Buffer | Bound | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| russh per-channel queue | 16 messages (russh default 100) | `session.rs` `CHANNEL_BUFFER` |
| Chunk being coalesced | < 64 KiB + one packet | `outbox.rs` `MAX_CHUNK` |
| Event queue to the UI | 8 chunks | `outbox.rs` `EVENT_QUEUE` |
| Input queue from the UI | 64 commands, full → `InputError::Busy` | `lib.rs` `COMMAND_QUEUE` |

When the UI falls behind, tern stops reading the channel, russh's queue fills, and russh stops
reading the socket, so the server slows down instead of tern's memory growing.

So the default scrollback is **5,000 lines**, configurable. A fresh tab pays only for what it has printed.

## Paint

| Item | Cost | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Viewport snapshot (`Terminal::lines`), 200×50 | 22 µs/frame, 240 KB transient (freed each frame) | release-build timing, 2026-10-05, #3 |

That is 0.13% of a 60 fps frame, with no steady-state memory, so it stays (#3 closed wontfix).

## Budget

Idle RSS with one connected tab, release build, measured with `scripts/measure-rss.sh`.
The first measurement sets the baseline; every release records a new row and may not regress >10%.

| Date | Commit | Scenario | RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-05 | tern-ssh (uncommitted → first commit) | `examples/connect` release, `seq 1 2000000` (16.9 MB) from strong-b, fast reader | 6 MB peak |
| 2026-10-05 | same | same, reader stalled 6 s (backpressure) | 6 MB peak |
| 2026-10-05 | tern-term | `local_demo` release, one idle local shell, 900×560 window (GPUI + fonts + Metal, no SSH) | 82 MB |
| — | — | app with one idle tab | not yet measured |
