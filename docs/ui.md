# UI spec

tern's UI is modeled on zeron (https://github.com/zeronsh/zeron, MIT). Its feature list,
`docs/research/feature-inventory.md`, and its native GPUI code (`crates/ui/src/`) are the reference.
Reference screenshot: `apps/landing/public/assets/app-screenshot.jpg`.

## No-slop rules

- **Every number comes from zeron's source, never from eyeballing.** Each value below names where it came from.
  When the inventory (written for the old Electron app) and the native code disagree, the native code wins.
- **Nothing generic.** No stock gradients, no emoji in chrome, no default gpui-component look left
  untouched, no placeholder buttons that do nothing. A control ships working or doesn't ship.
- **Copy the implementation, not just the look.** Motion, sizing and the theme layer stack are taken
  from zeron's `motion.rs` / `theme.rs` / `shell.rs` and adapted, with the attribution header.
- **Checked by eye.** Each feature is accepted only after a screenshot of the running app is put next to
  zeron's and looked at. Numbers that matter are measured from the running app.

## Later (not in the first version)

- Right pane: SFTP file browser, same resize/transition rules as zeron's diff pane (360–760px, default 520, cap 52%).
- Theme library with VS Code theme import (zeron `crates/theme/src/vscode.rs`).
